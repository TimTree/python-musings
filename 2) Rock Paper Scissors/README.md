# Python Musings - Rock, Paper, Scissors
Simple rock, paper, scissors game against the CPU, best to 3.

## Python Objectives
* Basic variables
* Comments
* Functions (the def keyword, use indents instead of curly braces)
* Return statement
* Importing libraries
* Lists (works like arrays in JavaScript)
* Tuples (read-only lists. Lists are in [], tuples are in ())
* Dictionary
* While loop

Feels weird not to put semicolons at the end of each line!
