# Python Musings - First Python
Here's my first Python script I wrote back in April 2013 (found on a flash drive). Enter your age, and find out what the script thinks about you.

## Python Objectives
* Print to console
* User input
* Casting
* If statement

There's NO error checking for non-numeric inputs. I would've added that now, but I'd like to keep the script true to my 2013 self.

The same goes for not using else if statements (elif).
